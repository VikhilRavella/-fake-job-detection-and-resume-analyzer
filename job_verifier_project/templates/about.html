        <h2>About Job Verifier</h2>
        <p>
            Job Verifier is a tool designed to help job seekers identify potentially fraudulent or fake job postings. With the rise of online job portals, the number of scams has also increased, targeting unsuspecting job applicants. This project aims to provide a simple and effective way to verify the legitimacy of a job posting before you apply.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Use Job Verifier</h3>
        <p>
            Using Job Verifier is easy. Simply navigate to the "Predict" page, where you will find three options:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Paste Text:</strong> Copy the full text of the job description and paste it into the text area.</li>
            <li><strong>Upload Resume/Image:</strong> If you have a screenshot of the job posting or a document, you can upload it directly.</li>
            <li><strong>Live Screen Analysis (Coming Soon):</strong> This future feature will allow you to analyze a job posting directly on your screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once you have provided the job posting details, click the "Analyze Now!" button. Our system will then analyze the content and provide you with a prediction on whether the job is likely to be legitimate or fraudulent.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is This Important?</h3>
        <p>
            Fake job scams can have serious consequences. They can be used to steal personal information (identity theft), trick you into paying for fake training or background checks, or even involve you in illegal activities. By using Job Verifier, you can add an extra layer of protection to your job search and avoid these potential risks.

        <h3>How to Avoid Fake Jobs</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to using tools like Job Verifier, here are some tips to help you spot and avoid fake job postings:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be Wary of Unsolicited Offers:</strong> Be cautious of job offers that you did not apply for, especially if they come from personal email addresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for Professionalism:</strong> Look for spelling and grammar mistakes in the job description. Legitimate companies usually have professional and well-written postings.</li>
            <li><strong>Vague Job Descriptions:</strong> Be suspicious of job descriptions that are very vague about the role and responsibilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Unrealistic Salaries:</strong> If the salary seems too good to be true for the role, it probably is.</li>
            <li><strong>Requests for Money:</strong> A legitimate employer will never ask you to pay for a job, training, or a background check.</li>
            <li><strong>Verify the Company:</strong> Do a quick search for the company online. Check if they have a professional website and social media presence.</li>
        </ul>
